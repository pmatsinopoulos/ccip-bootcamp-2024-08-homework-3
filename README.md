# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

# Day 3, Exercise 4

I have used
```bash
$ npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/TransferUSDC.ts --network avalancheFuji
```

This deployed the `TransferUSDC` contract to Avalanche Fuji.
